1. Identified a problem or inefficiency in a process related to quality or development, and implemented a change to improve it

* Regression testing was delayed at first because we used a manual testing approach for functional, smoke, sanity, and regression testing. Presented this matter to the team, and all members agreed.hence offering some more recommendations, one of which was to use Cypress to introduce automation for UI and api testing.
* Because there were more than 500 test cases in HomeBazaar, the execution time took more than three hours. To reduce this time, parallel testing was introduced.Subsequently, the execution time was significantly shortened.Also for API testing used Api plugin get the Ui of Apis requests.


2. Made changes to prevent defects from occurring or improve the quality before reaching the testing stage

* I observed a recurrent problem where requirements ambiguities were causing miscommunications between the development team and stakeholders, which later in the process resulted in rework and defects. This was caused by unstructured and constantly changing requirements. I suggested creating an organised requirements collection and clarification procedure as a solution to this.To ensure that everyone engaged had a shared understanding, I also developed thorough documentation that outlined acceptance criteria and use cases for each feature.


3. Attempted to convince someone to change the way they were working, even though they didnâ€™t want to

* When I saw that many team members on a recent project were accustomed to using selenium and would hesitate to move to cypress, I persuaded them by outlining the following benefits:Quick execution, simplicity of setup, automatic scrolling, when executing the test, and capturing screenshots. testing via a browser.
